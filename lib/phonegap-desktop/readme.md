#Phonegap desktop
The aim of this project is to allow developers to use PhoneGap in a desktop browser.

Have a look at the [online demo](http://jxp.github.com/phonegap-desktop/demo/) (Best viewed in Chrome)
This is a copy of the phonegap [kitchen sink demo](https://github.com/mwbrooks/phonegap-kitchen-sink) using my desktop library.


All PhoneGap API calls are simulated and the data returned is determined by json files.

See the Wiki for some notes on getting started.


###Current Status:

Added section headings and links to API docs  
Added Cordova File API methods  
Moved Connection API for v2.2 and up (previous can still be used)

###Next Steps:

Update features for recent API changes
Look at using new getUserMedia method for camera capture (latest release of Chrome, Opera)  
Look at emulation (not simulation) of other features  
Investigate overriding Firefox geolocation
